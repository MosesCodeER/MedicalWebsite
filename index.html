         <h1>Pandemic effect on the world</h1>
        <p class="Para"> 
            The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.

            Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the world’s 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets. Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and their families. For most, no income means no food, or, at best, less food and less nutritious food. 
            
            The pandemic has been affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its fragility. Border closures, trade restrictions and confinement measures have been preventing farmers from accessing markets, including for buying inputs and selling their produce, and agricultural workers from harvesting crops, thus disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and reducing access to healthy, safe and diverse diets. The pandemic has decimated jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk. As breadwinners lose jobs, fall ill and die, the food security and nutrition of millions of women and men are under threat, with those in low-income countries, particularly the most marginalized populations, which include small-scale farmers and indigenous peoples, being hardest hit.
        </p>
        <p class="Para">In the COVID-19 crisis food security, public health, and employment and labour issues, in particular workers’ health and safety, converge. Adhering to workplace safety and health practices and ensuring access to decent work and the protection of labour rights in all industries will be crucial in addressing the human dimension of the crisis. Immediate and purposeful action to save lives and livelihoods should include extending social protection towards universal health coverage and income support for those most affected. These include workers in the informal economy and in poorly protected and low-paid jobs, including youth, older workers, and migrants. Particular attention must be paid to the situation of women, who are over-represented in low-paid jobs and care roles. Different forms of support are key, including cash transfers, child allowances and healthy school meals, shelter and food relief initiatives, support for employment retention and recovery, and financial relief for businesses, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. In designing and implementing such measures it is essential that governments work closely with employers and workers.

            Countries dealing with existing humanitarian crises or emergencies are particularly exposed to the effects of COVID-19. Responding swiftly to the pandemic, while ensuring that humanitarian and recovery assistance reaches those most in need, is critical.</p>
             <h2>Covid effect on your body</h2>
             <p class="Para">A virus infects your body by entering healthy cells. There, the invader makes copies of itself and multiplies throughout your body.

                The coronavirus latches its spiky surface proteins to receptors on healthy cells, especially those in your lungs.
                
                Specifically, the viral proteins bust into cells through ACE2 receptors. Once inside, the coronavirus hijacks healthy cells and takes command. Eventually, it kills some of the healthy cells. There is some evidence, though, that the Omicron variant doesn’t attack lung tissue as much as other variants did.</p>
                <p class="Para"> COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, starts with droplets from an infected person’s cough, sneeze, or breath. They could be in the air or on a surface that you touch before touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. That gives the virus a passage to the mucous membranes in your throat.The virus moves down your respiratory tract. That’s the airway that includes your mouth, nose, throat, and lungs. Your lower airways have more ACE2 receptors than the rest of your respiratory tract. So COVID-19 is more likely to go deeper than viruses like the common cold.Your lungs might become inflamed, making it tough for you to breathe. This can lead to pneumonia, an infection of the tiny air sacs (called alveoli) inside your lungs where your blood exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p>
                     <H3>Common cold or a reminder of how a plague works</H3>
                     <p class="Para">The first reported US case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was on January 19, 2020, in a man who had returned from Wuhan, China, 4 days earlier. The next day, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started screening at 3 major airports hosting international travelers (John F. Kennedy International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, and San Francisco International Airport). The first cases that were not related to travel were confirmed on February 26 and 28, 2020, signaling that COVID-19 was not limited to cases being “imported” by travelers from China and was thus much more of a threat to the US.By the time 2020 ended, the number of cases and deaths in the US totaled more than 20 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 346 000 deaths. The surge in cases and deaths continued in January 2021 as a result of holiday travel for Christmas and New Year’s that health officials repeatedly warned against.Of course, COVID-19 has also destroyed what had been an economy that had reached a half-century low unemployment rate—3.5%—in February 2020. By April 2020, the unemployment rate was 14.7%, with 20.5 million people having lost their jobs and more than 20% of the labor force filing for unemployment benefits. Although the unemployment rate started to decline by May, the damage was still substantial going into the summer, with 15 million fewer jobs in June than had existed in February. The decline in the unemployment rate continued, reaching 7.9% in September and stabilizing at 6.7% for November and December.</p>
                     <p class="Para">However, the stability in the overall unemployment rate late in the year masked the very different experiences of men and women in both labor force participation and unemployment. Women lost more than 5 million jobs in 2020, and 2.1 million women have left the workforce since the pandemic started, which means they are no longer even counted among the unemployed. Many of these women needed to leave their jobs because they have primary caregiver roles in families, a role exacerbated by the closure of so many schools.

                        December’s economic numbers clearly reflect the disproportionate harm that the pandemic has had on working women. The US workforce lost 140 000 jobs in December, but this number reflects a loss of 156 000 jobs for women, with a net gain of 16 000 jobs for men—meaning that job losses for women accounted for all of the increase in employment occurring in December. This differential response does not always happen during recessions. Frequently, recessions occur in male-dominated industries. This time, however, the decline in the demand for workers occurred primarily in female-dominated businesses, such as restaurants, retail, and hospitality.
                        
                        Although the explosive growth in cases and deaths has been the cause of so much pain in the country, some important positive developments have also occurred during this period, the most obvious example being the unprecedented speed in producing 2 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that meet standards of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), even if only on an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) basis. The FDA used EUA as a yardstick in the absence of approved and available alternatives and in cases where the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks. Treatments for COVID-19 have also improved over the course of 2020.
                        
                        On the other hand, the distribution of vaccines has had a bumpy start, although the reasons why it has been so challenging for some states is not clear. States had been invited to submit plans for vaccine distribution in September and given a mid-October deadline. Historically, the preservation of public health has been primarily the responsibility of state and local governments, with the authority deriving from the state’s general police powers. The problem with setting up the distribution plans and sites for COVID-19 vaccination may be more a problem of states not having been given adequate resources during the pandemic and the economic slowdown that followed as opposed to their not being accustomed to having this responsibility. In fact, having the states determine the distribution may have provided an important level of flexibility on how the distribution occurs. Because the 2 vaccines that have been authorized each require 2 doses, the amount needed to vaccinate a given population size is double what it would otherwise be. These vaccines also need to be transported and stored at different and specific temperatures, which complicates their distribution.</p>
                        <H4><strong>What you should do if you get covid </strong></H4>
                        <p class="Para">If you test positive and are an older adult or someone who is at high risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, treatment may be available. Contact a healthcare provider right away after a positive test to determine if you are eligible, even if your symptoms are mild right now. You can also visit a Test to Treat locationexternal icon and, if eligible, receive a prescription from a provider. Don’t delay: Treatment must be started within the first few days to be effective.

                            If you have a fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19. Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home. 
                            Stay home. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas and do not go to places where you are unable to wear a mask.
                            Take care of yourself. Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to help you feel better.
                            Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.
                            Avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis if possible.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Para">As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home. If possible, you should use a separate bathroom. If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a well-fitting mask.

                            Tell your close contacts that they may have been exposed to COVID-19. An infected person can spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) before the person has any symptoms or tests positive. By letting your close contacts know they may have been exposed to COVID-19, you are helping to protect everyone.
                            
                                See COVID-19 and Animals if you have questions about pets.
                                If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, someone from the health department may call you. Answer the call to slow the spread.

                                Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, or other symptoms.
                                Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider and local health department. Your local health authorities may give instructions on checking your symptoms and reporting information.Cover your coughs and sneezes

                                Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
                                Throw away used tissues in a lined trash can.
                                Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
                            
                                Take steps to improve ventilation at home

                                Improve ventilation (air flow) at home to help prevent from spreading COVID-19 to other people in your household.
                                Clear out COVID-19 virus particles in the air by opening windows, using air filters, and turning on fans in your home.
                                Use this interactive tool to learn how to improve air flow in your home.
                            
                                If you are sick, wear a well-fitting mask

                                You should wear a mask if you must be around other people or animals, including pets (even at home).
                                Wear a mask with the best fit, protection, and comfort for you.
                                You don’t need to wear the mask if you are alone. If you can’t put on a mask (because of trouble breathing, for example), cover your coughs and sneezes in some other way. Try to stay at least 6 feet away from other people. This will help protect the people around you.
                                Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2 years, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is not able to remove the mask without help.

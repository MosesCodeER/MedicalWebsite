        <h1>About Us and Covid Help</h1>
        <p class="para">A medical group/IPA is a network of independent doctors who own and operate their own practices (instead of being salaried employees of a larger healthcare system). These doctors join a medical group so they can stay independent while getting the support they need to take care of patients.

        All our doctors are in charge of their own practices, meaning they have their own policies and procedures when it comes to patient care. Being part of Hill Physicians means our doctors get access to resources and tools that make their lives, and the lives of their patients, easier.</p>
